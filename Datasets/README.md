## Datasets here!

The folder contains all raw datasets including listings, reviews, calendars and neighbors. 

Some nearby places of interest as well as MRT stations are also included. The names, ratings and descriptions of the popular sites are scraped by [Octoparse](https://www.octoparse.com/) on the [Google Top sights in Singapore](https://www.google.com/travel/things-to-do/see-all?highlight_id=8a00f7b43043ed26&dest_mid=%2Fm%2F06t2t&dest_state_type=sattd&hl=en-SG&gl=sg&g2lb=2502548%2C2503781%2C2503837%2C4258168%2C4270442%2C4306835%2C4317915%2C4328159%2C4371335%2C4401769%2C4419364%2C4463666%2C4464738%2C4466980%2C4482194%2C4482438%2C4486153%2C4491350%2C4495816%2C4496891%2C4497651%2C4270859%2C4284970%2C4291517). And the geolocation data (latitude, longitude) is obtained through [New One Map API](https://docs.onemap.sg/#introduction). 
MRT Station geolocation data is acquired from the [data.world website](https://data.world/hxchua/train-stations-in-singapore).
